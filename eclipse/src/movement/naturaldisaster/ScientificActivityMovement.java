/**
 * The ScientificActivityMovement class representing the movement of scientits witin a disaster area
 * 
 * When natural disasters occur there are often international scientists around the area collecting scientific evidences
 * Sometimes this is even done before a disaster occures (when the disaster is foreseeable),
 * yet sometimes scientists can only arrive in the aftermath of the disaster when the disaster is not foreseeable.
 * Some scientists usually volunteer for helping the incoming disaster relief organizations with their relief work before leaving the country
 * All scientists usually go home to sleep in the evening
