 * The NonInjuredPopulationActivityMovement class represents the movement of non-injured people in a disaster zone
 *
 * Activity simulates daily activities of non-injured people in a disaster;
 * Some people are actively walking in the surroundings of their homes, trying to find family members etc. 
 * Some try to find food and water distribution locations
 * Other help disaster relief organizations with cleanup operations 
 * Whilst others are patrolling in the streets to ensure public order
 * All non-injured people go home to sleep in the evening
